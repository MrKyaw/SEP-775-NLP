Multi-Agent Healthcare iBots (Chatbots)

The Multi-Agent Healthcare iBots project aims to revolutionize healthcare communication by deploying multimodal and multi-routed conversational chatbots for patient care and support. Leveraging LLAMA Text and Vision(may be) Models alongside GenAI and Large Language Models (LLMs), these intelligent bots will provide personalized assistance, including symptom assessment, appointment scheduling, and healthcare guidance. The system utilizes CrewAgentsâ€”autonomous virtual assistants that collaborate seamlessly to manage complex patient interactions across various touchpoints, including text, voice, and image-based inputs(may be).

By integrating multimodal capabilities, the iBots will process not only text but also images and video, enabling features such as visual symptom checking and medical document analysis. Patients will receive real-time, context-aware responses tailored to their medical history, preferences, and current conditions. The multi-agent architecture allows for efficient workload distribution and task routing, ensuring timely and accurate healthcare support. Using open-source models, the system ensures flexibility, scalability, and transparency while continuously evolving through community-driven improvements. These iBots will empower patients with immediate healthcare assistance, reduce administrative burdens on staff, and improve overall patient satisfaction.
